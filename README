Github is bad.

Github doesn't work correctly without JS-enabled,
Github made a site which required months to implement a dark theme (that's not
how much CSS-changing requires!),
Github is registered in USA,
Github is of Microsoft.

Please, don't use Github. Github != git. If you need a place to host the
repositories consider these services:
	* https://repo.or.cz
	* https://rocketgit.com
	* your own instance of git + cgit <3

Github sucks! Don't suck with it!
