Github is bad.

Github doesn't work correctly without JS-enabled,
Github made a site which required months to implement a dark theme (that's not
how much CSS-changing requires!),
Github is registered in USA,
Github is of Microsoft,
Github is not free sofware,
Github is centralized.

Please, don't use Github. Github != git. If you need a place to host the
repositories consider these services:
	* codeberg.org
	* gitea.com
	* git.disroot.org
	* sr.ht
	* repo.or.cz
	* rocketgit.com
	* host something on forgejo, gitea, cgit or something!

Github fucking sucks! Don't suck with it!
